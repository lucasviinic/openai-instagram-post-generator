## OpenAI Instagram Post Generator

This project explores audio transcription using OpenAI's Whisper API, followed by the generation of social media content, including summaries and hashtags, through prompts for GPT. Additionally, it leverages the DALL-e API to create images based on the transcribed text and employs Instabot to structure and facilitate direct posting on Instagram.

### Topics covered in the project

- Transcribing audio using the Whisper API from OpenAI.
- Based on the transcription, generating elements through prompts for GPT itself, such as:
  - A summary for posting on a social network (in this case, Instagram);
  - Hashtags and other elements that can assist in the construction of a post;
- Generating images from this text using the DALL-e API, also linked to OpenAI.
- Structuring this content to make a direct post on Instagram, using Instabot.
