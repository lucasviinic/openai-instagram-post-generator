## OpenAI Instagram Post Generator



### Topics covered in the project

- Transcribing audio using the Whisper API from OpenAI.
- Based on the transcription, generating elements through prompts for GPT itself, such as:
  - A summary for posting on a social network (in this case, Instagram);
  - Hashtags and other elements that can assist in the construction of a post;
- Generating images from this text using the DALL-e API, also linked to OpenAI.
- Structuring this content to make a direct post on Instagram, using Instabot.
